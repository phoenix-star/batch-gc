      "I decided to implement simple garbage collection for envrionment variables, with Windows batch scripting. The results are less than stellar. I quickly realized that it's easy to write batch scripts; it's not easy to write scripts well. Sure this could have been done in Powershell, BASH, or, any other shell language.

      "batch-gc is a collection of batch scripts that allow for references, reference counting and garbage collection in a CMD shell/environment. Rather than create environment variables with values, the scripts allow for creating envrionment variables with references that can be shared and deleted, marked as garbage. References, and other values necessary for the logic are stored in files rather than the environment space. This was due to some design decisions, but the unintended consequence is that users get very few perks of using references without adding more variables into the environment space.\n",

This implies that there's a `Reference` pointing to an `Object`, that isn't held by any variables, meaning, it's `Object` is not being used. Unusued `Object`s take up memory, so it's nice to get rid of them. This is the point of garbage collection. `Garbage Collection` looks at `Reference Counts`, and if a `Reference` has a count of 0, it's corresponding `Object` and the `Reference` are removed from memory.\n",

This meant **manually** making space in memory for variable; **manuaully** clearing that space when you were done; **manually** tracking which variables referenced sections of memory; **manually** a lot of other things and memory. \n",

As an abstraction for memory management, developers get the joys of creating `Objects` and variables fewer hassles.
